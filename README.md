# C Algos

Practicing some algorithms in ye olde C programming language

**Disclaimer:** 

The algorithms here are for me and myself and with the sole purpose of sharping my skills in C.
They are not necesarily fast or beautiful and not meant to be used for production code or school assignments.
If you are experienced in C and stopping by and see anything that can be improved, that's more than welcome :)
